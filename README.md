# Image-Classification
In this project. I train an image classifier for camera trap images. I use transfer learning because the images available are not sufficient for the data hungry neural network.

I used VGG16 pretrained model and changed the output layer and then trained it with my own data.

>## Contributions

You can contribute by suggesting better ways of dealing with the transfer learning.

All contributions will be much appreciated.
